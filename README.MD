# Minecraft Mod Creation Pack
This is essentially updated MCP for 1.17+
This uses a fork of MCPConfig that is updated to Gradle 7 to decompile minecraft and patch it
## Requirements
- JDK 16
- 1.17 installed
- The git commandline tool
- Eclipse 2021.03 or newer

You can read MCPConfig's license here https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MCPConfig/blob/master/LICENSE

## Using
1) Download the pack from here https://github.com/TwelvianZeta/MinecraftModCreationPack/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
2) Run install.bat and wait for the cmd prompt to close
3) Your done! Just import the folder (the one with batch files) as an eclipse project to start coding!

### Note: Do not redistribute any mods u make using this. That is against TOS and copyright. I will be working on a way to reobfuscate in the reobfuscation testing branch (its the only other one as of right now).
